## Requirements

## User Stories 
* As a user I want to be able to Select Vowels or Constantans.
* As a user I want the rules of Countdown to be implemented. 
* As a user I want to be able to input my highest value word.
* As a user I want feedback as to whether my word is valid.
* As a user I want feedback of the highest value word.
* As a user I want game aspects (I.e. scores). 

## Usage Example
 The program allows the player input a name then to Pick 8 Vowels or Constantans and is given 30 seconds to come up with the highest value word they can. They are prompted as to whether their word is valid and if it is not, they are displayed the highest possible word and decrease score, if they are valid but not the highest value they gain half score, if valid and highest they gain full score. Option to continue again or quit.
